# Installation

MQT YAQS is a Python package available on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.yaqs/). It can be installed on all
major operating systems with all
[officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).

:::::{tip}
:name: uv-recommendation

We recommend using [{code}`uv`][uv]. It is a fast Python package and project
manager by [Astral](https://astral.sh/) (creators of [{code}`ruff`][ruff]). It
can replace {code}`pip` and {code}`virtualenv`, automatically manages virtual
environments, installs packages, and can install Python itself. It is
significantly faster than {code}`pip`.

If you do not have {code}`uv` installed, install it with:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Linux and macOS

```console
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Windows (PowerShell)

```console
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

:::

::::

See the [uv documentation][uv] for more information.

:::::

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: installer

:::{tab-item} {code}`uv` _(recommended)_
:sync: uv

```console
uv pip install mqt.yaqs
```

:::

:::{tab-item} {code}`pip`
:sync: pip

```console
python -m pip install mqt.yaqs
```

:::

::::

Verify the installation:

```console
python -c "import mqt.yaqs; print(mqt.yaqs.__version__)"
```

This prints the installed package version.

## Integrating MQT YAQS into Your Project

To use the MQT YAQS Python package in your project, add it as a dependency
in your {code}`pyproject.toml` or {code}`setup.py`. This ensures the package is
installed when your project is installed.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} {code}`uv` _(recommended)_

```console
uv add mqt.yaqs
```

:::

:::{tab-item} {code}`pyproject.toml`

```toml
[project]
# ...
dependencies = ["mqt.yaqs>=<version>"]
# ...
```

:::

:::{tab-item} {code}`setup.py`

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    # ...
    install_requires=["mqt.yaqs>=<version>"],
    # ...
)
```

## Development Setup

Set up a reproducible development environment for MQT YAQS. This is the
recommended starting point for both bug fixes and new features. For detailed
guidelines and workflows, see {doc}`contributing`.

1. Get the code: <!-- rumdl-disable-line MD013 -->

   ::::{tab-set}

   :::{tab-item} External Contribution

   If you do not have write access to the
   [munich-quantum-toolkit/yaqs](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/yaqs)
   repository, fork the repository on GitHub (see
   <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>) and clone
   your fork locally.

   ```console
   git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/yaqs.git mqt-yaqs
   ```

   :::

   :::{tab-item} Internal Contribution

   If you have write access to the
   [munich-quantum-toolkit/yaqs](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/yaqs)
   repository, clone the repository locally.

   ```console
   git clone git@github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/yaqs.git mqt-yaqs
   ```

   :::

   ::::

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```console
   cd mqt-yaqs
   ```

3. Create a branch for local development:

   ```console
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. Install the project and its development dependencies: <!-- rumdl-disable-line MD013 -->

   We highly recommend using modern, fast tooling for the development workflow.
   We recommend using [{code}`uv`][uv].
   If you don't have {code}`uv`,
   follow the installation instructions in the recommendation above
   (see {ref}`tip above <uv-recommendation>`).
   See the [uv documentation][uv] for more information.

   ::::{tab-set}
   :sync-group: installer

   :::{tab-item} {code}`uv` _(recommended)_
   :sync: uv

   Install the project (including development dependencies) with [{code}`uv`][uv]:

   ```console
   uv sync
   ```

   :::

   :::{tab-item} {code}`pip`
   :sync: pip

   If you really don't want to use [{code}`uv`][uv], you can install the project
   and the development dependencies into a virtual environment using
   {code}`pip`.

   ```console
   python -m venv .venv
   source ./.venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install -U pip
   python -m pip install -e . --group dev
   ```

   :::

   ::::

5. Install pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality: <!-- rumdl-disable-line MD013 -->

   The project uses pre-commit hooks for running linters and formatting tools on each commit.
   These checks can be run manually via [{code}`nox`][nox], by running:

   ```console
   nox -s lint
   ```

   They can also be run automatically on every commit via [{code}`prek`][prek] (recommended). To set
   this up, install {code}`prek`, e.g., via:

   ::::{tab-set}

   :::{tab-item} Linux and macOS

   ```console
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/latest/download/prek-installer.sh | sh
   ```

   :::

   :::{tab-item} Windows (PowerShell)

   ```console
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/latest/download/prek-installer.ps1 | iex"
   ```

   :::

   :::{tab-item} {code}`uv`

   ```console
   uv tool install prek
   ```

   :::

   ::::

   Then run:

   ```console
   prek install
   ```
